                    Permalab is a permanent laboratory in a 20ha valley in south Portugal created to enhance inner and outer transformation. In everyday life we experiment with tools and methods to empower individuals and reinforce trust while working on solutions for a life in cooperation with nature.</p>

                    <p class="top10">It is a coworking place and playground for holistic design that provides a safe place for experiments, retreats and education for different generations and cultures.</p>

    We are welcoming designers, researchers, facilitators and artists to open shortterm and longterm laboratories as modules for a sustainable living model. It’s a space for action and experimentation in contact with the material world and the cooperation between nature and people. If you are longing for a new culture feel invited to bring in what is really important for you, what you wish to see and live in the world. We will have intensive time to integrate and plan the following years laboratories!

We invite people to take care of this space and to contribute in reinforcing it with awareness and care. We see this place as the ashram for intuitions, invisible energy, creativity, senses and spirituality out of a structured world. We see this place as an autonomous part of the project and as a place for researching in our inner the space of peaceful awareness.

                    We decided to find land in portugal. It is a region that is strongly connected with the natural forces of water, sun, air and earth. It is also far away from industrial and commercial centers and is on the line between desertification and potential paradise. Healing the land from former exploitation is our inspiration for inner work and the best way to reconnect with nature.
