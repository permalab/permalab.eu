    We are welcoming designers, researchers, facilitators and artists to open shortterm and longterm laboratories as modules for a sustainable living model. It’s a space for action and experimentation in contact with the material world and the cooperation between nature and people. If you are longing for a new culture feel invited to bring in what is really important for you, what you wish to see and live in the world. We will have intensive time to integrate and plan the following years laboratories!

We see this place as an autonomous part of the project and as a place for researching in our inner the space of peaceful awareness.

To many of us, it seems that the world is at a momentous tipping point, one where the global ecology and culture are reaching a crisis point where they will either breakdown or breakthrough. At times like these, small groups can have influence far beyond their size. A radical shift in thinking and living needs to take place – starting from ourselves we put us in service to support global changes.

                    We decided to find land in portugal. It is a region that is strongly connected with the natural forces of water, sun, air and earth. It is also far away from industrial and commercial centers and is on the line between desertification and potential paradise. Healing the land from former exploitation is our inspiration for inner work and the best way to reconnect with nature.

It is 20 minutes from the ocean and near other interesting international projects. It can host 20-50 people and have a variety of shapes and microzones.

Learning how to relate authentically with ourself and others is the base for letting go old patterns and install the seeds for a new culture!
