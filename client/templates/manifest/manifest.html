							If we want to leave old habits, beliefs and behaviors behind us, we consciously need to establish new patterns,structures and methods.
							The model, that we propose here, is just a beginning of searching and exploring new solutions. We are really glad about constructive feedbacks!
							We are not following dogmas, therefore open for questioning the status quo and experimenting new ways into the answers.</p >

We celebrate the state of failing as an act of self-acceptance and connection with reality.  Allowing ourselves to be seen in a moment of vulnerability open the door of support, unity and inner transformation. 
We commit to share what moves us and touch deeply………falling, losing orientation and trust is a part of the process.
There we want to find solutions how to support each others in growing and overcoming our old structures and believes that want to be transform.
Shwing us vulnerable create the basement for trust and cooperation on all levels our personality.
Examples:
Creates transparency and trust between us. (allow us to support each other) 
Fear, pain and our limits in general are the basic triggers of change.
