                <h3>Mindfulness Retreat for adults and children </h3>
                <p>The retreat is a laboratory space, where all participants explore joyfully the challenge to create a living together that really serves our intention of mutual respect, empathy and love. We invited about 15 adults and 6 children between 0 and 6 years. Basic knowledge in empathy and nonviolent communication are very helpful. We will offer two introductory workshops in nonviolent communication before the retreat, one will be specific for parents.</p>
